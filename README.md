# Shortest Path Visualizer 🌠

A visually stunning web application to explore shortest path algorithms like BFS and Dijkstra's on a customizable grid. Built with React and Tailwind CSS, this project features a cosmic-themed UI with shooting stars and a starry background, making pathfinding an immersive experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to set start/end points and place obstacles on a responsive rectangular grid.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Visualize Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm with animated path drawing.
- **Cosmic UI**: Transparent grid with glowing cells, shooting stars, and a starry background for a futuristic feel.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with dynamic grid dimensions.
- **Obstacle Mode**: Toggle to add/remove obstacles and block paths.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build tooling.
- **clsx** and **tailwind-merge**: For managing dynamic class names.
